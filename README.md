## Exploring SQL Injection Mitigation
This project is about mitigating SQL injection that are related to user validation. For this program, the vulnerabilies are from **Tautology Attacks**, **Union Attacks**, **Additional Statement Attacks**, and **Union Attacks.** 
To mitigate this attacks, there are two mitigation functions, one that represents a weak mitigation, and the other that represents a strong mitigation.

_Example (lab06-2.cpp):_
```c++
-- empty
```

### Run from command line
Additionally, you can run the program be sending comand line arguments. The valid arguments are: tautology, union, state, and comment. Please refer to the following as an example (look at the run command):
``` c++
compile:    g++ -std=c++17 lab06-2.cpp -o lab06-2
run:        .\lab06-2 union
```
